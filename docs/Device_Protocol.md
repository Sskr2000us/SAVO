# Device / Protocol Notes

## Supported device types (candidate)
- Thermometer (BLE / Wi‑Fi)
- Oven / range (cloud APIs, local LAN APIs)
- Scale (optional)

## Normalized device state (draft)
- Connectivity: connected / disconnected
- Sensor: current temp, target temp, battery
- Capability: set target temp, start/stop, mode

## Pairing considerations
- BLE scanning permissions (mobile)
- Wi‑Fi onboarding
